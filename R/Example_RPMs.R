#'
#' A dataset of RNA abundance of 118 genes in four Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes (WT, sov, vcs, vcs sov). Four biological replicates were collectred 0, 7.5, 15, 30, 60, 120, 240, 480 min after blocking transcription. RNA was extracted, subjected to ribodepletion, and sequenced by RNA-seq (Illumina 50 nt single end reads).
